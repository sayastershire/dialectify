**DIALECTIFY: Transform your sentence into another strange dialect.**
========================

**What is the aim for the project**
---
General goal: To show the diversity of Indonesian language based on the loanwords itself (fyi: Indonesian has had loanwords ranging from the Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, but mostly Sanskrit during the classical era, and Portuguese, French, and Dutch during the occupation).
Technical goal: To implement Boyer-Moore string-search algorithm to replace texts with predefined dictionary (currently stored in a CSV file; planning to migrate to sqlite when I have the time to spare on relearning SQLite3 or person to help)

**Current holdbacks**
---
* Lots of data taken from wiktionary, need a hand on data fetch algorithm that takes synonyms from wiktionary (and KBBI, but beware of KBBI's weekly limitation)
* 

**What am I searching for in the project**
---
* Indonesian (or someone who understands Indonesian because the project involves in processing texts in the language)
* Someone with the knowledge of HTML + CSS (bare) and PHP (no framework, https://dev.to/gypsydave5/why-you-shouldnt-use-a-web-framework-3g24 much)
* A lot of down time
* Private experience in projects? this project is only for fun btw don't hope on getting work experience from this because the HR will probably laugh if they see this haha
